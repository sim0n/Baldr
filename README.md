## What is Baldr anti-cheat

Baldr is an anti-cheat base which is meant to elevate development for anti-cheating software

## Features
* Easy to integrate checks
* Easy to integrate commands
* Easy to integrate player trackers

* Flexible check system, make any type of check

* Automatic integrating for checks, commands, listeners and trackers

* Mediocre packet tracking system

#### Notes
There are a few check examples already added that showcases what the current system provides. However, they're nowhere finished

#### Compiling
As there is no public repo (that I'm aware of) that hosts CraftBukkit you'll have to build it yourself with [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-8-8). After this simple use the default goal 
```xml
mvn package
```

#### Usage
If you're going to make a full fledged anti-cheat using this base and release/sell it then all I ask for is credit
